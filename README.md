-Android application/game for old people with dementia. 

It has three games, one that is meant to stimulate the mind (Information.java, Information_1.java, Information_2.java), 
the second is meant to help improve visual awareness (VisualActivity.java, Visual_1.java, Visual_2.java) 
and the last is meant to help improve their auditory skills (AudioActivity.java, Audio_1.java, Audio_2.java). 

The app requires the user to Register and Login using an email address. After creating an account and/or logging in,
the user can choose to play the games in Traning mode to simply test out the games (no game data is saved) 
or the user can play the game normally, where the points earned after every game are saved in a "MariaDB" database and can be seen on the results section of the application.
